# Interview repo

This repo was created for an interview with the problem description below

> You are a gamer in a FIFA competition. The competition is a fantasy-based league, where you bid for a squad of 22 players. Every player is available for the auction until they’ve been sold. In other words, once a player is selected in/sold to a team, they can’t be bought by another team. Given there’s a salary cap to be decided closer to the auction, how would you prepare and prioritise in selecting the 22 players in your squad?
